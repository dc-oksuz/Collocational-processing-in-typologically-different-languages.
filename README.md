# Collocational_processing_in_typologically_different_languages.

 Collocations are understood to be integral building blocks of language processing, alongside individual words. Here we provide crosslinguistic evidence for the role of individual word and phrasal frequencies in processing collocations in typologically different languages, English and Turkish.

The "corpus_bnc_tnc" file includes the R codes for the corpus analyses and "experiments" files includes the R codes for mixed effects models analysing Turkish and English speakers' response times.
